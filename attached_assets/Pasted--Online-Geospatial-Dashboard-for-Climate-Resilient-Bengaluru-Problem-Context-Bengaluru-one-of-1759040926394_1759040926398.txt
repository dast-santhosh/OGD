🌍 Online Geospatial Dashboard for Climate-Resilient Bengaluru
🔹 Problem Context

Bengaluru, one of the fastest-growing cities in India, faces severe urban challenges: shrinking green spaces, extreme heat islands, erratic rainfall, flooding, water scarcity, and rising air pollution. NASA Earth observation data has revealed rapid land-use changes, declining lake extents, and increasing surface temperatures in and around the city. If left unchecked, these trends threaten public health, infrastructure stability, and environmental sustainability.

City leaders (BBMP, BDA, BWSSB, BESCOM) urgently need actionable insights to plan sustainable growth while ensuring people’s wellbeing. But current city planning is fragmented, lacking real-time, data-driven monitoring of land, air, and water resources.

🔹 Proposed Solution

We propose an Online Geospatial Dashboard that integrates NASA Earth observation data with local city datasets to create a real-time decision-support platform for urban planners, policymakers, and citizens.

This dashboard will:

Map Urban Heat Islands – Use MODIS/Landsat thermal data + NDVI to identify overheating neighborhoods and low-vegetation areas.

Track Water Bodies & Flood Risk – Monitor lake shrinkage, water quality (using turbidity, bloom detection from EO data), and highlight flood-prone zones using precipitation/topography datasets.

Analyze Air Quality & Growth Corridors – Overlay aerosol (AOD/PM₂.₅) and NO₂ datasets with population and land-use change maps to identify pollution hotspots.

Forecast Vulnerabilities – Provide predictive insights on extreme weather risks, heatwaves, and flooding events using climate model integrations.

Enable Community Participation – Residents can upload local reports (flooded streets, missing trees, sewage leaks), creating a citizen science + NASA data fusion ecosystem.

🔹 Key Features

🌡️ Heat Map Layers – Visualize daily/seasonal temperature anomalies across Bengaluru.

💧 Water Health Monitor – Detect lake shrinkage and pollution patterns (e.g., Bellandur foam events).

🌬️ Air Quality Dashboard – City-wide map of PM₂.₅, NO₂, and ozone levels.

🏙️ Urban Growth Analyzer – Identify unplanned sprawl using night-time lights and land-use change datasets.

📊 Policy Dashboard – Custom views for BBMP, BWSSB, BESCOM, Parks Dept., and citizen groups.

📱 Community App Integration – Mobile-friendly module for residents to contribute ground-level data.

🔹 Stakeholder Involvement

City Leaders (BBMP, BDA, BWSSB, BESCOM): Decision-makers use the dashboard to allocate resources for parks, drainage, clinics, and transit planning.

Local Communities: Citizens provide hyperlocal observations that complement satellite data, improving accuracy.

Researchers & NGOs: Use dashboard data for studies, awareness campaigns, and sustainable interventions.

🔹 Why NASA Data?

MODIS/Landsat – Land Surface Temperature, NDVI, water bodies.

VIIRS – Night-time lights for urban growth.

Aqua/Terra MODIS & TROPOMI – Air pollution (AOD, NO₂, CO).

GRACE & GPM – Groundwater storage, precipitation for flood/drought analysis.

Sentinel + NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) – High-res land-use change mapping.

🔹 Expected Impact

✅ Climate-Resilient Growth: Helps planners design greener, cooler, and more livable neighborhoods.
✅ Water Security: Protects lakes, reduces urban flooding, and ensures sustainable supply.
✅ Healthier Communities: Cleaner air and cooler zones improve public health.
✅ Citizen Empowerment: Democratizes access to NASA data, making planning transparent.
